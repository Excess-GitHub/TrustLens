Add the following PNG icons to this folder for your PWA:

- pwa-192x192.png      (192x192)
- pwa-512x512.png      (512x512)
- pwa-512x512-maskable.png (512x512, maskable safe area)
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 recommended)

These filenames are referenced by the PWA manifest in `vite.config.js` and by `index.html` for iOS.
You can generate them from your logo using your design tool or an icon generator.
